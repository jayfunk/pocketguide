      <description><![CDATA[Throughout the burn you will find many different camps, and many different people. In the midst of all the adventuring, many require rest for a short while. This is when Camp of Ooo comes in. We started as an Adventure Time themed camp and have moved to a movie theatre that hosts several cartoons and mind bending videos. We welcome all to come and regain their strength in our cuddle puddle as they allow their minds to continue adventuring through film and humor. We run from dusk till dawn and provide all ages friendly shows until 10 pm. Highlights include: Adventure Time, Reefer Madness (the musical), Orgazmo, Rick & Morty, Steven Univers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and many more.]]></description>
