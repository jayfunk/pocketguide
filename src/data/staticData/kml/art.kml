There will be a screen showing the album art/current song playing, as well as who chose it (if they entered their name). This encourages interactivity and discussion regarding music with people who come to our camp.]]></description>

They all have common objectives: a ritual cleansing for the mind, body, and soul.<br><br>At the Alchemy Smoke Bath Experience will provide an opportunity for Burners to create their own variation of these ritualistic practices. A large tent with all sides covered (to capture the smoke) will be erected and decorated inside with Moroccan string lights and hand painted mural banners featuring elemental symbols. The central focus inside will be a terracotta brazier used to generate smoke from sage, lavender, juniper and other herbs. Participants can use this environment to relax, rejuvenate, cleanse, and commune. Shells will be provided for skin scraping, feathers offered for wafting the smoke, and various acoustic instruments available to use for rhythmic meditation and harmony. Burners are welcome to bring their own drums, flutes, and other instruments.]]></description>
